    "## Description of How Problem Was Solved\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the 'hint' given in the lab manual, the algorithm was structured as a divide-and-conquer algorithm using a pivot value to divide the array.  The fact that the pivot is revealed to be the j<sup>th</sup> element after partitioning was also given in the lab manual.  Combining these two pieces of information led to the creation of an algorithm that splits the array based on an arbitrary pivot value and recurses on one of the pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow down the search space the array [ a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> ] is split into two subarrays, [ a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>j-1</sub> ] and [ a<sub>j+1</sub>, a<sub>n</sub> ] where the first array contains elements less than the pivot, and the second contains elements greater than the pivot.  The posibilities for elements equal to the pivot was handled later.  The original algorithm design creates new lists at every step, but elements could also be swapped in place similar to quicksort.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the array is split, either the pivot was the k<sup>th</sup> element, or there are two options for further processing.  In the case that the number of elements smaller than the pivot is greater than k, then k must be smaller than the pivot, so the algorithm should continue on the less-than array.  In the other case, where the number of elements smaller than the pivot is less than k, the algorithm should continue on the greater-than array.  However, k must be updated to represent the number of elements that were thrown out.\n",

If the value of k is less than the size of lt_list, the algorithm recurses into lt_list, otherwise the value of k is reduced by the size of lt_list.  If k was larger than the size of lt_list, the algorithm does the same with eq_list.  If k was larger than the size of both lists, the algorithm recurses into gt_list. As such, k is being adjusted to reflect the number of elements that have been thrown out.

    "Based on collected benchmark data, the average run time for the retrivel of k via the Python library sort function is faster than the implemented split algorithm for small-medium list sizes. This may simply be due to the fact that our algorithm is implemented in Python, where as the Python library sort function is implemented in C under the hood. For large list sizes, it can be seen that over time the run time of library sort out grows the run time of the implemented algorithm, until the library sort run time is longer than that of the implemented algorithm. This is due to the implemented algorithm having a time complexity of O(n) while the Python library sort (which is Tim Sort) has a time complexity of O(nlogn).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, for small-medium list sizes it is faster to use the Python library sort function, and for larger list sizes it is faster to use the implemented split algorithm. However, it must be noted that for the implemented algorithm, since a random pivot value is selected from the middle of the list, it is possible for the algorithm to take more or less time based on whether a desirable pivot value has been selected among recursions. It also must be noted that if both methods of k retrieval were implemented in the same language (whether that be in Python or C), it is likely that the implemented algorithm would be faster as it has a superior time complexity compared to Tim Sort."
